vim-EasySelect
==============

When I start to use vim, confuse me is that I can't find a command or binding key to **select all**. After I am familiar to Vim, I know that I can use `ggVG` command in normal mode to **select all**, even I can select a range of lines, like **Begin/Eend Select** in Notepad++, such as select lines from 10 to 10001, just enter `10GV10001G` in normal mode. But these commands are not natural, so I think that I can create a plugin to simplify selection work.
